      <p>There is a man who looks at me where I walk my dog in the park.</p>
<p>Outside the French embassy, up the street from the university where I teach, he stands in a long black coat and dark hat, peering over a significant beard maintained with care for decades, or so one can deduce from its broad, stately sweep.</p>
<p>He is a painting on a wall. Not a mural, not a portrait. More like an icon.</p>
<p>The wall marks the boundary of what was the Jewish ghetto in Vilnius, established during the Nazi occupation.</p>
<p>This representation, more than full-length&mdash;greater than life-size&mdash;rendered in a stenciled style, was placed here as a reminder&mdash;one of many in the surrounding area&mdash;of the kinds of lives that used to pass not just behind, through, around, and in front of walls like this, but also&mdash;and perhaps most importantly&mdash;with no special regard for them: unheeded and undetermined by the boundaries they came to impose.</p>
<p>He has been given a nickname: “The Wise Man.” His arms are folded, his hands tucked into opposing sleeves, his head tilted knowingly. But his posture is one of forbearance, as much as wisdom, or anything else. One feels suffered to look, but not to linger.</p>
<p>I pass him with the briefest acknowledgement. I return home, and he does not follow me.</p>
<p><strong>&mdash;</strong></p>
<p>This man’s likeness, I came to find, was drawn from an archival photograph.</p>
<p>From this fact followed the quick draining of all life, wisdom, forbearance, and otherwise from the painting that purported to represent it.</p>
<p>Did this man live in this sector? Or in this city? In what ways was he wise, if any? In what ways did he stand for what he has been made to stand for, now? And how, and to whom, did he convey whatever wisdom he did possess?</p>
<p>Not by standing against a wall, I could be reasonably sure.</p>
<p><strong>&mdash;</strong></p>
<p>There is not, it turns out, a man who looks at me where I walk my dog in the park.</p>
