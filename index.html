      <p>Reading without taking notes is as good as not reading.</p>
<p>What was the last text you read, of any significant length or substance &mdash; book, chapter, article, or blog post? How long ago did you read it? How much of it has stayed with you? What do you remember more clearly: the text itself, the circumstances in which you read it, or the feeling of accomplishment that came over you as you finished it?</p>
<p>I, for one, cannot remember the last book I read. Or article, chapter, or blog post.</p>
<p>That is not to say I don&rsquo;t remember what they were. I remember titles, general topics, authors' names, sometimes more. But the anecdote on such-and-such a page? The footnote with all the citations that seemed so promising? The statement of argument a third of the way through the introduction? Gone. Like they never existed and like we, therefore, never encountered each other, wherever it was we did, in fact, encounter each other.</p>
<p>Because we did, in fact, encounter each other.</p>
<p>So what was it all for?</p>
<p>Whenever I am reading something that I find to be of significant moment&mdash;compelling, inciting, good&mdash;I make a text file on my computer. In that file, I write down whatever strikes me about what I am reading as I am reading it. Sometimes I type out direct quotes from the text. But often I only describe, in a few words, what is being discussed on a particular page: analysis of a primary or secondary source, discussion of a concept, definition of a key term. Beside each notation I write a page number.</p>
<p>I do not underline or highlight anything in the text itself. I do not write notes in the margins. Anything that I want to note about the text gets written down in the file, outside of the text itself. I do not do this in the interest of keeping a clean original document, digital or otherwise. I do it in the interest of making worthwhile the time I have spent with the text.</p>
<p>If my encounter with a text is going to result in little more than quickly fading memories, a few marginal notes, or underlines/highlights that&mdash;in the rare event that I find myself reading the text again&mdash;I cannot recall the original rationale for, what was it all for? I might as well stop reading and go for a walk.</p>

      <p>There is a man who looks at me where I walk my dog in the park.</p>
<p>Outside the French embassy, up the street from the university where I teach, he stands in a long black coat and dark hat, peering over a significant beard maintained with care for decades, or so one can deduce from its broad, stately sweep.</p>
<p>He is a painting on a wall. Not a mural, not a portrait. More like an icon.</p>
<p>The wall marks the boundary of what was the Jewish ghetto in Vilnius, established during the Nazi occupation.</p>
<p>This representation, more than full-length&mdash;greater than life-size&mdash;rendered in a stenciled style, was placed here as a reminder&mdash;one of many in the surrounding area&mdash;of the kinds of lives that used to pass not just behind, through, around, and in front of walls like this, but also&mdash;and perhaps most importantly&mdash;with no special regard for them: unheeded and undetermined by the boundaries they came to impose.</p>
<p>He has been given a nickname: “The Wise Man.” His arms are folded, his hands tucked into opposing sleeves, his head tilted knowingly. But his posture is one of forbearance, as much as wisdom, or anything else. One feels suffered to look, but not to linger.</p>
<p>I pass him with the briefest acknowledgement. I return home, and he does not follow me.</p>
<p><strong>&mdash;</strong></p>
<p>This man’s likeness, I came to find, was drawn from an archival photograph.</p>
<p>From this fact followed the quick draining of all life, wisdom, forbearance, and otherwise from the painting that purported to represent it.</p>
<p>Did this man live in this sector? Or in this city? In what ways was he wise, if any? In what ways did he stand for what he has been made to stand for, now? And how, and to whom, did he convey whatever wisdom he did possess?</p>
<p>Not by standing against a wall, I could be reasonably sure.</p>
<p><strong>&mdash;</strong></p>
<p>There is not, it turns out, a man who looks at me where I walk my dog in the park.</p>
