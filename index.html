<p>Each person&rsquo;s notetaking practice is&mdash;and must be&mdash;distinct. No two people have the same needs when it comes to making, organizing, and accessing notes.</p>
<p>Adopting someone else&rsquo;s practice just because they can loudly sing its merits, or even clearly demonstrate its efficacy, may very well be an exercise in shortsightedness. A person&rsquo;s notetaking practice could certainly have merits and be effective&mdash;<em>for them</em>&mdash;but there can be no guarantee of universality in such things.</p>
<p>So, a few questions to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you want (or need) to take notes at all?</li>
<li>What kind of information are you trying to store and keep track of?</li>
<li>When and how do you want to come across the stored information again?</li>
<li>Will the notes be an end in themselves or raw materials for other writings?</li>
</ul>
<p>My own answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>I take notes for the purposes of academic research and lecturing.</li>
<li>I store and keep track of the thoughts, ideas, and insights of others, as encountered in books, articles, presentations, etc., as well as my own thoughts, ideas, and insights, as they occur to me, most often in response to the thoughts (etc.) of others.</li>
<li>I want to come across the stored information both as I am writing other notes, for the purposes of making connections between ideas and insights, and as I am writing research papers and lectures.</li>
<li>My notes are both an end in themselves, to the extent that they facilitate and constitute my thinking, and raw materials for other writings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-starting-points">My Starting Points</h2>
<h3 id="the-inbox-note">The &ldquo;Inbox&rdquo; Note</h3>
<p>I keep a note that I call an &ldquo;inbox&rdquo; note, which is just a plaintext file on my computer. It is one of two entry-points to my notetaking pactice. When I have an idea that I want to keep track of, instead of making a new note right away (a new file on my computer), I go to my &ldquo;inbox&rdquo; and start writing things down, a bit freeform, right at the top.</p>
<p>I consider this space like a sketch pad. There is no pressure to produce anything polished or fully thought through. If I end up writing something worth keeping, I copy it into a new note (that is, a new text file&mdash;each of my notes is a separate text file, all stored in a folder called &ldquo;Notes&rdquo;).</p>
<p>If the idea doesn&rsquo;t really develop or seem worth keeping, I either delete it, or just leave it there. I will write the next idea above it, and it will simply be pushed down a few lines. The bottom of my inbox is something of a graveyard of ideas. Sometimes I go through and clean them out, to &ldquo;clear the inbox,&rdquo; as it were. Sometimes when I do this I find something worth recovering.</p>
<p>The purpose of the &ldquo;inbox&rdquo; note is to eliminate any friction that might disrupt the actual taking of a note when the need/desire to take a note arises. It allows me to get right to the important business of putting an idea down and avoid having to fool with any other, less pressing business, like finding the right place to put the idea. I have a shortcut key that opens the inbox note right away. Highly recommended.</p>
<h3 id="the-literature-note">The &ldquo;Literature&rdquo; Note</h3>
<p>Often I am taking notes on something I&rsquo;m reading, be it a book, an article, or a website. After entering the appropriate citation information into my bibliographic database and assigning the resource a unique <a href="../posts/citekeys.html">citekey</a>, I skip the &ldquo;inbox&rdquo; and go straight to creating a new note dedicated to the material I am reading. This I call a literature note.</p>
<p>The name of each literature note is the resource&rsquo;s unique citekey followed by its author and title, like so: &ldquo;Conrad1899 - Joseph Conrad - Heart of Darkness.txt&rdquo;. By having a programmatic titling scheme, I always know right where to find my notes for what I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>As I read, I keep the literature note open and write down ideas, quotations, and questions as they occur to me, always making reference to the appropriate page number when relevant.</p>
<p>If any idea or line of thought arises while reading that seems interesting enough to stand on its own, I can make a separate note for it, and include a reference to that new note in the literature note itself. A literature note could be a page-by-page account of a resource, or it could be a list of references to stand-alone notes. Most often it is somewhere in between.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The matter of inserting references to other notes can be facilitated by any number of progams.

      <p><em>Use <strong>citekeys</strong> to consistently and uniformly correlate in-text references
with original source materials, not just in final submissions but <strong>also in
notes and drafts</strong>.</em></p>

<p><strong>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</strong></p>

<p>For long research projects, it is necessary not only to keep straight a
variety of sources but also to ensure that in-text references to those
sources are unambiguous. This allows readers to trace all lines of thought to
their original contexts. This is obviously a requirement of all formal
publications.</p>
<p>But a clear and consistent citation practice should not be neglected in the
writing that leads up to a final submission, such as notes, outlines, drafts,
etc. When you are still the project&rsquo;s primary (or only) reader, you must
still be able to trace lines of thought to their origins.</p>
<p>In many cases, this may not be difficult. In the middle of a project, when
everything is fresh in your working memory, you might be able to make sense
of all kinds of non-standard forms of citation, no matter how informal: &ldquo;cite
book on national identity formation,&rdquo; &ldquo;quote comes from that article we read
during week 3,&rdquo; &ldquo;see Foucault 257.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the larger a project is and the more time that passes between note-taking
and final submission the more effort will be involved in tracing such
citations to their sources.</p>
<p>In the case of a career researcher, informal citations like the above will
inevitably lose their meaning as their originary contexts recede into the
past. Which book on national identity formation was that? Which class? Which
book by Foucault, and <em>which edition</em>?</p>
<p>The use of <em>citekeys</em> can greatly reduce the effort involved in mainlining
clear lines of connection between citations and sources&mdash;not just in final
products but in notes and drafts as well, and not just in single projects but
in a lifetime of research.</p>
<h2 id="citekey-basics">Citekey Basics</h2>
<p>A citekey (or citation key) is a unique code assigned to a particular piece
of source material that can be used to quickly and consistently refer to that
source.</p>
<p>A citekey is typically composed of some combination of the source&rsquo;s year of
publication, its primary author&rsquo;s surname, and/or a short version of its
title.</p>
<p>Here are three different citekeys, in three common styles, that could be used
for the same source, the book <em>Imagined Communities</em> by Benedict Anderson.
Each offers a far more precise indication of what source is being referred to
than the comparatively ambiguous &ldquo;cite book on national identity formation&rdquo;:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">Anderson2006
andersonImaginedCommunities2006
anderson2006_ImaginedCommunities
</code></pre><p>It is important to note that citekeys are not expected to be clearly
understandable to anyone other than the researcher who assigns them.
Consider that &ldquo;Anderson2006&rdquo; in the example above could refer to any number
of publications from the year 2006 by anyone with the surname Anderson.</p>
<p>In this way citekeys are unlike ISBN or DOI numbers: they are not universal
indicators&mdash;they do not point directly and unambiguously to particular
sources themselves.</p>
<p>Rather, citekeys point to a researcher&rsquo;s own individual collection of
bibliographic entries (more on this ahead). Citekeys offer, as a result, a
simple, private system of shorthand for encoding reference information into
any written document, all without the work entailed in writing out full
formal citations and bibliographic entries in every instance.</p>
<p>Given their simplicity and ease of use, citekeys help to lower any barriers
that might otherwise have impeded the inclusion of clear, reliable citations
in even the most informal of written documents, including and especially
those that are not intended for publication. They thereby help to eliminate
any temptation to insert ambiguous and cryptic notes-to-self that risk
baffling more than benefiting.</p>
<h2 id="your-bibliographic-database">Your Bibliographic Database</h2>
<p>For texts that are intended to be published, citekeys offer great
flexibility, as they can be easily replaced with formal citations in whatever
citation style is appropriate to the intended context, such as Chicago, MLA,
Harvard, APA, etc.</p>
<p>This requires maintaining a centralized repository of bibliographic
information wherein all citekeys are listed with relevant information about
the associated source. This may sound more complicated than it is.</p>
<p>While it is possible to manage bibliographic information with one of the many
popular reference management programs&mdash;such as Zotero, Endnote, or
Mandeley&mdash;it is equally possible to maintain nothing more than a simple text
document of entries like the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">@book{Anderson2006,
        title = &#34;Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism&#34;,
        author = Anderson, Benedict&#34;,
        year = &#34;2006&#34;,
        publisher = &#34;Verso&#34;,
        address = &#34;London; New York&#34;,
}
</code></pre><p>The above entry happens to be written in a standardized format called BibTeX,
often used or at least supported by reference management software. For the
sake of future-proofing your bibliography, it might be worthwhile to use such
a standardized format.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But such entries can easily be written and maintained in any format and
without such software, using nothing more than a plaintext editing program
like TextEdit (MacOS) or Notepad (Windows). The most important thing is to
include all the relevant information about the source and associate it with a
unique citekey.</p>
<p>From such information, it will be possible to produce citations and
references in any of a seemingly endless array of standardized citation
styles.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="key-rule-be-consistent">Key Rule: Be Consistent</h2>
<p>No matter what style of citekey or method of bibliography management is used,
internal consistency is essential. Use a consistent citekey style&mdash;I use
AuthorYEAR, like &ldquo;Anderson2006&rdquo;&mdash;so that each source is associated with a
only single citekey. Do not use both &ldquo;Anderson2006&rdquo; and
&ldquo;andersonImaginedCommunities2006.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also, take care to ensure that each citekey is associated with only a single
source. If you add a source by a different Anderson also written in 2006,
assign it a unique citekey, like &ldquo;Anderson2006a&rdquo; or &ldquo;Anderson2006-1.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Note that using citekeys also makes it easy to include and distinguish
between different editions of a single text. You might also have reason to
cite the first edition of <em>Imagined Communities</em> (1983) alongside the
reprint. Luckily, there is no confusing &ldquo;Anderson1983&rdquo; and &ldquo;Anderson2006.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="citekeys-in-use">Citekeys In Use</h2>
<p>Choosing a citekey style, assigning citekeys to sources, and keeping them all
matched up in a bibliography database is only the beginning.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done all that, how to go about putting them to use in your
writings?</p>
<p>Here is an example from my reading notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Heise cites [#Anderson2006], who make a similar connection between representations and identity-formation.[5][#Heise2008]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was not taking these notes for any specific project or a potential
publication where accurate citations would be necessary. Nevertheless, it was
so simple to include the citekeys and a page reference that I didn&rsquo;t consider
<em>not</em> doing it.</p>
<p>It was the use of citekeys, formatted in a distinct syntax&mdash;in brackets,
preceed by the hash sign<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>&mdash;that made it effortless to find this
reference (along with several others) to Anderson&rsquo;s <em>Imagined Communities</em> in
a file on my computer that is not obviously about the text in question and
that I haven&rsquo;t looked at or thought about since I wrote it. How about that?</p>
<h2 id="bonus-pdf-management">Bonus: PDF Management</h2>
<p>Aside from helping you keep your citations legible and locate deeply embedded
notes in the recesses of your file system, citekeys can also help you keep
track of PDFs and other digital documents. No longer worry over what to name
that PDF. Enter its information into your bibliography file, assign it a
citekey, and use the citekey as the name of the file. You&rsquo;ll never have to
guess what &ldquo;Anderson2006.pdf&rdquo; contains.</p>
